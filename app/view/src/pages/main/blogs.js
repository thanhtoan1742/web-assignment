                  Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an
                  activity of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we
                  are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our
                  place in the universe.

                  The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as
                  we know it are everywhere, so there's no reason to think that
                  Earth would be unique in that regard. Whether of not the life
                  became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if
                  we find that.

                  If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are
                  large enough and carry enough energy into our system to
                  disrupt transportation, communication, the food chains, and
                  that can be a really bad day on Earth.

                  For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd
                  cosmic thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to
                  myself or share them with people who might be interested.

                  Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. I kind of want to know
                  what happened there because we're twirling knobs here on Earth
                  without knowing the consequences of it. Mars once had running
                  water. It's bone dry today. Something bad happened there as
                  well.

                      If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be
                      government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the
                      space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it
                      has unquantified risks.

                          can't get investors.
